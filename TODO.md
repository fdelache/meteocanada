# Remaining features to implement
The following is a list os feature I would like to implement, along with an example prompt that can be used by the AI agent to implement such feature.

1. [x] Add location selection + offer an auto-detect setting
2. [x] Add search functionality to find another city, and remove the hardcoded Montreal city
3. Add possibility to build a list of cities we can switch between. We should be able to also remove a city from the list
4. [x] In the radar map pre-fetch the radar images, so when we playback it goes smoother
5. Add a settings for the radar map to select between a 3h or 1h radar history for the playback
6. [x] Refresh the weather data when we drag down the app`s screen. Should work for both the forecast page, and the radar map page
7. Allow possibility to move and zoom the Radar map
8. [x] Display the current radar map timestamp
9. [x] Display the time of current weather observations
